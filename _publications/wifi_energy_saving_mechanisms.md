This paper evaluates the performance of the most popular power saving mechanisms defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard, namely the Power Save Mode (Legacy-PSM) and the Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD). The assessment comprises a detailed study concerning energy efficiency and capability to guarantee the required Quality of Service (QoS) for a certain application. The results, obtained in the OMNeT++ simulator, showed that U-APSD is more energy efficient than Legacy-PSM without compromising the end-to- end delay. Both U-APSD and Legacy-PSM revealed capability to guarantee the application QoS requirements in all the studied scenarios. However, unlike U-APSD, when Legacy-PSM is used in the presence of QoS demanding applications, all the stations connected to the network through the same access point will consume noticeable additional energy.
