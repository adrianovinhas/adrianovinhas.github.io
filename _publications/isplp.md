Inverse Combinatorial Optimization has become a relevant research subject over the past decades. In graph theory, the Inverse Shortest Path Length problem becomes relevant when people don’t have access to the real cost of the arcs and want to infer their value so that the system has a specific outcome, such as one or more shortest paths between nodes. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, relying on dif-ferent methods, and several applications have been suggested. This study explores an innovative evolutionary approach relying on a genetic algorithm. Two scenarios and corresponding representations are presented and experiments are conducted to test how they react to different graph characteristics and parameters. Their behaviour and differences are thoroughly discussed. The outcome supports that evolutionary algorithms may be a viable venue to tackle Inverse Shortest Path problems.
