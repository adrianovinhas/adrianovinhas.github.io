Hi, my name is Adriano Vinhas and I'm a Data Scientist who currently works for [FarePilot](https://www.farepilot.com/).

Originally started my career as a researcher in the Laboratory of Communications and Telematics of the University of Coimbra by investigating energy saving mechanisms in Wireless networks, I got my first contact to AI and data-related problems as a researcher in the [Computational Design & Visualization Lab](https://cdv.dei.uc.pt/) through the use of nature inspired strategies and Machine Learning techniques to solve optimization problems and study computer-generated art (computational creativity). Later on, I moved to London to work as Database Developer/Data Engineer in [Experian pH](http://www.experian.co.uk/).

I am a data aficionado who has experience and enjoys working around several stages of the data-driven environment, either by setting up a big data pipeline which focus on realtime and data integrity scenarios or working with a dataset and use it to answer questions by building models, through the use of Machine Learning. The perfect scenario is of course, finding automation in whis whole process and allow the machine to build the models and update them automatically using real data pipelines as inputs.

My main interests rely on Machine Learning and mostly Evolutionary Computation as I'm a big fan of nature-inspired approaches to solve optimization problems. Also a big fan of computer generated art and it amazes me how AI can produce so interesting results and their inherent questions around human vs. machine.
